                <p>Runic Magic is the most visible tip of a school of magic called the Northern Path. Runes symbols are compact magical devices, associated with sound, color, image, number, and forming a matrix of magical practice. They're used for magic, talismans, and more. In this the runes are like the Hebrew alphabet within the Qabbalah. Not the whole of the thing, but an indispensable and beautiful part of it.</p>
                <p>Runic Talismans can be designed for any purpose; for love, money, business, power, spiritual advancement, mental and physical capabilities and anything else you can think of.
